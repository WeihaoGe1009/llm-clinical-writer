# 🗓️ 2024-05-16 Progress Log

## ✅ Done Today
- 
* created github repo for main entrance and put in README.md
* created github repo directory for llm-clinical-writer
* installed dependencies
* started to use VSCode
* use ChatGPT to generate prototype for generate.py and app.py
* use ChatGPT to generate help scripts 

## 📌 Decisions
- 
* Use streamlit instead of pydash and gradio for faster prototyping
* Start with local run before acceleration
* start from minimal clinical document templates

## 🤔 Next Steps
- 
* look up for real clinical document templates
* convert the templates to minimal structures
* (maybe) generate instructive questions for the minimal structures 
 
* try with smaller model first for debugging purposes  
* change the output format (?) 


## 🧠 Notes
- 
* code runs very slow - smaller nlp model, cloud-deployment consideration - portability  
* "use llm to extend" option is inutil. We would definitely use llm. Also, if not chosing this option, it generates nothing. - do this part, create an outline and use llm to generate some concise arrangement or questions.
* find a way to cache models

* **after the first prototype** add some example prompt for AI to follow  
* **after the first prototype** contact clinicians to improve document quality
* **for very future** provide an unstructured text upload option
