## ‚úÖ Done Today

## üìå Decisions
- 
* focus on Clinical Trial Protocol template today, as time and energy is limited 
* Clinical Trial protocol follows ICH E6(R3) guideline, which is the latest good clinical practice. Following this one, it would provide a minimal requirement for the document. Other things can be developed above it. 

* NIH has a e-tool to submit the clinical trial protocol. Need to generate a dummy submission to see what is the content

* put more sophisticated clinical trial protocol into future phases.

## ü§î Next Steps
- 
* figure out NIH e-tool content
* other document templates
* smaller language models to make the code run
