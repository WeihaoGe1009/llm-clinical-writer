## ðŸ§­ How This Project Will Finish, Even If Blocked

If cloud deployment becomes unmanageable within the time Iâ€™ve scoped, I will:

- âœ… Build and finalize a working version using a small model locally
- âœ… Replace any LLM output with static or mocked results for demonstration
- âœ… Capture screenshots or screen recordings of the working interface
- âœ… Write clear README sections noting what works, whatâ€™s mocked, and what the next step would be
- âœ… Push this version as a finished deliverable

This project will still demonstrate:
- Interface design and usability
- Prompt structure and LLM planning
- Pipeline scaffolding and logic
